# Perudo
A tool to help you improve (cheat) in the game of Perudo (Liar's Dice) - please use responsibly

## How to use

Run <tt>interactive.py</tt> and you'll be prompted for the total number of dice in the game, the numbers on the dice in your cup for this round and whether or not the round is Palafico. You'll be shown the probabilities for all the available bids, which can assist you in choosing a new bid or doubting theirs by calling <i>"Dudo"</i>.

## Fairness

I used this to help improve my game and made other players aware of my advantage. Clearly if you use it without declaring so you are a bad sport.

## Limitations

The program does not incorporate the bids of others in the probabilities; only your dice and the total number on the table. In future, I would like to develop agents that learn to play against eachother. Even then, this would never account for prior knowledge of your opponents.
